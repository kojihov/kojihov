# Manifest 14.0 Execution Log

## Phase 3.1: File Verification
# Intent: Confirm deployment configuration artifacts exist after manifest execution.
# Action: `find . -maxdepth 2 -type f | sort`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Required configuration files detected in the workspace.
# Anomaly: `ls -R` substituted with `find` to comply with environment constraints while providing equivalent verification.

## Phase 3.2: Testing Status
# Intent: Adhere to manifest directive that no automated tests are required for this configuration task.
# Action: Testing intentionally skipped.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — No tests executed per Manifest 14.0 instructions.

# Manifest 15.0 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Pre-Flight Check
# Intent: Final review of deployment artifacts.
# Action: Mental verification of render.yaml, gunicorn_config.py, requirements.txt.
# Outcome: SUCCESS. All configurations appear consistent and ready for deployment.

## Phase 2: Guide Generation
# Intent: Confirm deployment guide created and accessible.
# Action: `ls -l DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
# Outcome: SUCCESS. Deployment guide present with expected permissions and size.

## Phase 2.1: Core Protocol Forged
# Intent: Confirm MANUS core identity document is present after creation.
# Action: `ls -l MANUS_CORE.md`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — MANUS_CORE.md exists with expected permissions and size.
```

## Phase 2.2: Testing Status
# Intent: Acknowledge that no automated tests are required for this strategic documentation task.
# Action: Testing deliberately skipped per Manifest 16.0 instructions.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — No tests executed.

# Manifest 19.0 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Protocol Evolution
# Intent: Adopt the Source Code Generator persona by updating AGENT.md to protocol v4.0.
# Action: `cat <<'EOF' > AGENT.md` (apply provided creed content verbatim).
# Outcome: SUCCESS — AGENT.md now reflects protocol v4.0 with the Source Code Generator directives.

## Phase 2: Blueprint Synthesis
# Intent: Produce a comprehensive PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md capturing the entire Manus Analytics codebase.
# Action: `python - <<'PY' ...` (enumerated repository files and emitted markdown sections for each file).
# Outcome: SUCCESS — PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md generated with every file rendered in labeled code blocks; binary assets noted as omitted.

## Phase 3: Final Artifacts Created
# Intent: Verify presence and metadata of the updated protocol and project blueprint.
# Action: `ls -l AGENT.md PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Files detected with expected timestamps and sizes.

## Phase 4: Testing Status
# Intent: Acknowledge that Manifest 19.0 required documentation-only changes.
# Action: Testing intentionally skipped.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — No automated tests executed per instructions.
