# Manifest 76 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Blueprint Update
# Intent: Restore dual-service deployment blueprint with distinct service identifiers.
# Action: Overwrote `render.yaml` to define `manus-analytics-console` (web) and `manus-analytics-telegram-bot` (worker) services sharing the existing environment group.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — File updated with keep-alive web service and bot worker entries.

## Phase 2: Documentation Refresh
# Intent: Align deployment instructions with the updated blueprint.
# Action: Revised `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to reference the new service names and shared environment group secrets.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Guide now directs operators to configure `manus-analytics-console` and `manus-analytics-telegram-bot`.

# Manifest 78 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Branch Preparation
# Intent: Isolate the unified deployment work on a dedicated branch.
# Action: `git checkout -b release/unity`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Working tree now tracking the `release/unity` branch.

## Phase 2: Unified Service Entrypoint
# Intent: Run the FastAPI web app and Telegram bot within a single process for Render deployment.
# Action: Replaced `main.py` with an async lifespan manager that starts bot polling in a background task and performs orderly shutdown.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Unified startup/shutdown logic authored.

## Phase 3: Deployment Blueprint Update
# Intent: Provide a Render blueprint compatible with the unified service model.
# Action: Overwrote `render.yaml` to define a single web service (`manus-analytics-unified`) with a `/health` probe and Python version pin.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Blueprint now reflects the combined web + bot deployment strategy.

## Phase 4: Test Suite Verification
# Intent: Validate that the codebase remains healthy after unifying the entrypoint.
# Action: `python -m unittest`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — All 10 tests passed (see console log for detailed output).
