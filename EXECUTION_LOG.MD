# Manifest 76 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Blueprint Update
# Intent: Restore dual-service deployment blueprint with distinct service identifiers.
# Action: Overwrote `render.yaml` to define `manus-analytics-console` (web) and `manus-analytics-telegram-bot` (worker) services sharing the existing environment group.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — File updated with keep-alive web service and bot worker entries.

## Phase 2: Documentation Refresh
# Intent: Align deployment instructions with the updated blueprint.
# Action: Revised `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to reference the new service names and shared environment group secrets.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Guide now directs operators to configure `manus-analytics-console` and `manus-analytics-telegram-bot`.
