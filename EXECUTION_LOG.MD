# Manifest 76 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Blueprint Update
# Intent: Restore dual-service deployment blueprint with distinct service identifiers.
# Action: Overwrote `render.yaml` to define `manus-analytics-console` (web) and `manus-analytics-telegram-bot` (worker) services sharing the existing environment group.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — File updated with keep-alive web service and bot worker entries.

## Phase 2: Documentation Refresh
# Intent: Align deployment instructions with the updated blueprint.
# Action: Revised `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to reference the new service names and shared environment group secrets.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Guide now directs operators to configure `manus-analytics-console` and `manus-analytics-telegram-bot`.

# Manifest 78 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Branch Preparation
# Intent: Isolate the unified deployment work on a dedicated branch.
# Action: `git checkout -b release/unity`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Working tree now tracking the `release/unity` branch.

## Phase 2: Unified Service Entrypoint
# Intent: Run the FastAPI web app and Telegram bot within a single process for Render deployment.
# Action: Replaced `main.py` with an async lifespan manager that starts bot polling in a background task and performs orderly shutdown.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Unified startup/shutdown logic authored.

## Phase 3: Deployment Blueprint Update
# Intent: Provide a Render blueprint compatible with the unified service model.
# Action: Overwrote `render.yaml` to define a single web service (`manus-analytics-unified`) with a `/health` probe and Python version pin.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Blueprint now reflects the combined web + bot deployment strategy.

## Phase 4: Test Suite Verification
# Intent: Validate that the codebase remains healthy after unifying the entrypoint.
# Action: `python -m unittest`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — All 10 tests passed (see console log for detailed output).

# Manifest 70 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Unified Blueprint Refresh
# Intent: Reapply the single-service Render blueprint so the bot and web endpoint run on the Free tier without worker support.
# Action: Updated `render.yaml` to provision `manus-analytics-service`, reusing the shared environment group and health probe.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Blueprint now deploys both utilities from one web service compatible with the Free plan.

## Phase 2: Documentation Alignment
# Intent: Guide operators through deploying the unified service.
# Action: Rewrote `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` to describe the single-service blueprint, required secrets group, and verification steps.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Documentation now matches the streamlined deployment flow.

## Phase 3: Regression Testing
# Intent: Confirm the unified configuration leaves runtime features intact.
# Action: `python -m unittest`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — All tests passed using the mongomock fallback for MongoDB.

# Manifest 71 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Unified Service Keep-Alive
# Intent: Restore the keep-alive heartbeat so the single-service deployment remains active on the Render Free tier.
# Action: Updated `main.py` to start a background thread that pings the deployed `/health` endpoint while the bot runs inside the FastAPI lifespan.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Unified service now prevents idle shutdowns and retains graceful startup/shutdown logging.

## Phase 2: Regression Testing
# Intent: Verify the unified entrypoint continues to operate with all subsystems.
# Action: `python -m unittest`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — 10 tests passed using the mongomock fallback (see console log for MongoDB unavailability notice).
