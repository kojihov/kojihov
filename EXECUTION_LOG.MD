### PART 2: AGENT SELF-ANALYSIS                          ###
################################################################

INSTRUCTION FOR THE AGENT:
Based on the audit data above, there is a synchronization problem between
the local environment and the remote GitHub repository, leading to merge conflicts.
Analyze the situation and describe, in your own words, a step-by-step plan
to resolve this. What actions should YOU take to create a clean Pull Request
that contains the necessary fix for render.yaml and can be merged without conflicts?

--- [START: Agent's Proposed Plan] ---
1. Snapshot the current workspace by creating a dedicated working branch (e.g., `sync/render-fix`) from the audited state so the remediation happens in isolation.
2. Fetch `origin/main` and reset a separate staging branch to that exact remote tip to ensure I have an unmodified view of what the maintainers expect.
3. Diff the staging branch against the workspace branch to confirm the only required change is the removal of the `healthCheckPath` directive in `render.yaml` (and any other intentional edits already committed locally).
4. Reapply the approved fix onto the staging branch (either by cherry-picking the minimal commit or editing `render.yaml` directly), then run the existing unit tests or targeted lint checks to confirm the blueprint remains valid.
5. Commit the fix on the staging branch with a clear message (e.g., `fix(deploy): remove unsupported worker health check`) and generate an updated EXECUTION_LOG.MD entry documenting the verification results.
6. Force-refresh the local `main` to match `origin/main`, merge the staging branch fast-forward (or rebase if required) so local `main` now contains the clean fix without historical noise.
7. Push the new branch (or open a PR) from the staging branch to GitHub, supplying the execution log as supporting evidence, then request review / merge to resolve the deployment issue.

# Manifest 62 Execution Log

## Phase 1-4: Prometheus's Plan Executed
# Intent: Package the verified workspace onto a clean release-final branch.
# Action: `git checkout -b release-final 0fc8948d829777cadb43c0cb94256a96414b2450`, `git checkout work -- .`, `git commit --allow-empty -m "feat: Final deployment-ready build"`
# Outcome: SUCCESS — release-final points to commit 52041a2, ready for push/PR preparation.

# Manifest 69 Execution Log

## Phase 1: Protocol Update
# Intent: Append non-negotiable standing orders to AGENT.md.
# Action: Added mandatory logging and push directives to the agent protocol.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — AGENT.md updated with new standing orders.

## Phase 2: Readiness for Deployment
# Intent: Prepare repository state for downstream deployment actions.
# Action: Verified working tree and ensured instructions captured for operator.
# Outcome: SUCCESS — Repository remains on branch 'work' with clean status.
